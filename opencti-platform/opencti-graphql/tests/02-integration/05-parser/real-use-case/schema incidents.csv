2457,25/07/2023,30,EU,GLOBAL,TETRA Radio Hacking Risks Global Infrastructure,VULNERABILITY,TRANSPORT,ENERGY,B1,HIGH,Unknown,"TETRA, Terrestrial Trunked Radio",WEB THREATS," - Reported on July 25, Dutch cybersecurity researchers have discovered significant vulnerabilities in the widely used TETRA radio technology, raising concerns about the safety of critical infrastructure worldwide – These vulnerabilities have been dubbed TETRA:BURST by researchers.

 - TETRA, or Terrestrial Trunked Radio, employed to control essential systems like power grids, gas pipelines, and trains, has been found to possess a deliberate backdoor in its encryption algorithm, allowing for relatively easy hacking.

The team at cybersecurity firm Midnight Blue made this alarming discovery and alerted relevant authorities. Despite efforts to raise awareness, many critical infrastructure entities remain unresponsive to the risks posed by these vulnerabilities.

 - Two of the flaws are characterized as critical. The first (CVE-2022-24401) is an oracle decryption attack that can be used to reveal text, voice, or data communication. It is made possible by the Air Interface Encryption (AIE) keystream generator's reliance on network time, which is broadcast publicly and without encryption.

 - The second (CVE-2022-24402) is an engineering weakness – the TEA1 [PDF] encryption algorithm, according to the researchers, ""has a backdoor that reduces the original 80-bit key to a key size which is trivially brute-forceable on consumer hardware in minutes.""

 - Researchers from Midnight Blue identified a backdoor in the encryption algorithm of TETRA radios, which are manufactured by companies such as Motorola, Damm, and Hytera. The intentional vulnerability, easy to exploit, allows attackers to compromise the network and execute malicious commands. These attacks can disrupt critical infrastructure operations and even enable unauthorized access to emergency services, posing a grave threat to public safety.

 - TETRA technology is widely used across the world, controlling vital infrastructure in more than 120 countries. For instance, in the Netherlands, the port of Rotterdam, public transport companies, most airports, and the C2000 communication system utilized by the police, fire brigade, ambulance services, and parts of the Ministry of Defence rely on TETRA.

 - Additionally, many critical infrastructure authorities in Germany, France, Spain, and various European countries, as well as several equivalent entities in the USA, depend on this radio technology.

 - The most concerning aspect of these vulnerabilities is how accessible they are to potential hackers. According to Midnight Blue, even individuals without extensive hacking expertise can infiltrate the TETRA network in under a minute using simple hardware. Once inside, attackers can execute malicious commands on critical infrastructure systems without detection, leading to severe consequences.",59502,https://www.hackread.com/power-grids-airports-tetra-radio-hacking-risks/,"https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5397898/tetra-lek-kritieke-infrastructuur-c2000-nederlanderse-onderzoekers

DocuSign",MALWARE," - Reported on July 25, the analysis of nearly 20 million information-stealing malware logs sold on the dark web and Telegram channels revealed that they had achieved significant infiltration into business environments.

 - Information stealers are malware that steals data stored in applications such as web browsers, email clients, instant messengers, cryptocurrency wallets, FTP clients, and gaming services. The stolen information is packaged into archives called 'logs,' which are then uploaded back to the threat actor for use in attacks or sold on cybercrime marketplaces.

 - The most prominent information-stealing families are Redline, Raccoon, Titan, Aurora, and Vidar, offered to cyber criminals on a subscription-based model, allowing them to conduct malware campaigns that steal data from infected devices.

 - While information stealers primarily target careless internet users who download software, such as cracks, warez, game cheats, and fake software from dubious sources, it has also been found to have a massive impact on corporate environments.

 - This is because employees use personal devices for work or access personal stuff from work computers, resulting in many info-stealer infections stealing business credentials and authentication cookies.

 - More specifically, as cybersecurity firm Flare explains in a new report shared with BleepingComputer, there are approximately 375,000 logs containing access to business applications such as Salesforce, Hubspot, Quickbooks, AWS, GCP, Okta, and DocuSign.

More specifically, Flare found the following in the examined stealer logs:

    179,000 AWS Console credentials
    2,300 Google Cloud credentials
    64,500 DocuSign credentials
    15,500 QuickBooks credentials
    23,000 Salesforce credentials
    66,000 CRM credentials

 - In addition to the above, there are about 48,000 logs that include access to ""okta.com,"" an enterprise-grade identity management service used by organizations for cloud and on-premise user authentication.

 - Most of these logs (74%) were posted on Telegram channels, while 25% were seen on Russian-speaking marketplaces, like the 'Russian Market.'",,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-400-000-corporate-credentials-stolen-by-info-stealing-malware/,,FINANCIAL GAIN,MEDIUM

 - Written in the Rust programming language, the malware is distributed in the form of bogus blockchain games and is capable of ""emptying crypto wallets and stealing stored password and browser data"" from both Windows and macOS machines. Realst was first discovered in the wild by security researcher iamdeadlyz.

 - Realst Infostealer is distributed via malicious websites advertising fake blockchain games with names such as Brawl Earth, WildWorld, Dawnland, Destruction, Evolion, Pearl, Olymp of Reptiles, and SaintLegend. Each version of the fake blockchain game is hosted on its own website complete with associated Twitter and Discord accounts.

 - 16 variants across 59 samples were identified, with the activity likely having links to another information stealer campaign called Pureland, which came to light earlier this March. Windows machines, on the other hand, are infected with RedLine Stealer.

 - The attack chains begin with threat actors approaching potential victims through direct messages on social media, convincing them to test a game as part of a paid collaboration, only to drain their cryptocurrency wallets and steal sensitive information upon execution.

 - The web browsers targeted for harvesting include Brave, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Vivaldi. Apple Safari is a notable exception. The malware is also capable of gathering information from Telegram and capturing screenshots.

 - The developments come as data captured via commercial information stealers are being packaged and sold for profit on dark web marketplaces and Telegram channels, with over 200,000 OpenAI credentials leaked via stealer logs in 2022 and 2023, according to multiple reports from Bitdefender and Flare.

 - The attacker used a “read-only reentrancy attack” to drain the funds, which is a type of attack that interrupts a multi-step process and then causes it to continue after a malicious action has been performed. Specifically, a “read-only” reentrancy is one that does not update the state of a contract.

 - According to the report, the attacker drained funds in two separate transactions using the externally owned account. The attacker relied on a vulnerability in “the callback and _updateReserves function” to manipulate a contract into reporting old values that had not yet been updated.

 - Era Lend is a fork of the Syncswap project, and CertiK claimed that other projects based on Syncswap may also be vulnerable to the exploit.

 - Era Lend team had also acknowledged the attack and paused the protocol’s zkSync contracts to prevent further exploits.

  - These vulnerabilities are difficult for auditors to spot, since typically, auditors and bug hunters are only concerned with entry points that modify state when looking for reentrancy. To help alleviate this problem, it has been recommended that auditors should use specialized software to aid them in finding these vulnerabilities.

 - EraLend is designed to maximize the capital efficiency while minimizing the risks associated with the dependency on external liquidity & oracles.

 - They are still heavily focused on Latin American financial institutions, but the changes in their techniques represent a significant risk to multi-regional financial organizations as well.

 - Casbaneiro, also known as Metamorfo and Ponteiro, is best known for its banking trojan, which first emerged in mass email spam campaigns targeting the Latin American financial sector in 2018.

 - Infection chains typically begin with a phishing email pointing to a booby-trapped attachment that, when launched, activates a series of steps that culminate in the deployment of the banking malware, alongside scripts that leverage living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to fingerprint the host and gather system metadata.

 - Also downloaded at this stage is a binary called Horabot that's designed to propagate the infection internally to other unsuspecting employees of the breached organization.

 - This adds credibility to the email sent, as there are no obvious anomalies in the email headers (suspicious external domains), which would typically trigger email security solutions to act and mitigate. The emails include the same PDF attachment used to compromise the previous victim hosts, and so the chain is executed once more.

 - What's changed in recent spam waves is that the attack is kick-started by a spear-phishing email embedded with a link to an HTML file that redirects the target to download a RAR file, a deviation from the use of malicious PDF attachments with a download link to a ZIP file.",,https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/casbaneiro-banking-malware-goes-under.html,,FINANCIAL GAIN,LOW

In an exclusive research report shared with Hackread.com, the company revealed details of multiple security vulnerabilities in the widely used message queuing service.

 - The vulnerabilities allow remote code execution and denial of service attacks (DoS attacks), mainly impacting Windows-based devices with MSMQ installed.

 - FortiGuard Lab’s research report, authored by Wayne Low and published on July 24, 2023, explains that the vulnerabilities have been categorized as critical. The details of each flaw are as follows:

FG-VD-23-001: Message Queuing Exactly-One-Delivery (EOD) Header Out-of-Bounds Read
FG-VD-23-002: Message Queuing Message Header Out-of-Bounds Write
FG-VD-23-015: Message Queuing Compound Message Header Out-of-bounds Write

 - MSMQ is a standalone Windows server hosted under MQSVC.EXE. Microsoft developed this proprietary messaging protocol much on the lines of the open-source RabitMQ so that applications running on different computers can communicate in a failsafe manner.

2503,26/07/2023,30,GLOBAL,,Critical MikroTik RouterOS Vulnerability Exposes Over Half a Million Devices to Hacking,VULNERABILITY,DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE,,B1,HIGH,Unknown,MikroTik RouterOS,WEB THREATS," - Reported on July 26, a severe privilege escalation issue impacting MikroTik RouterOS could be weaponized by remote malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and seize full control of vulnerable devices.

 - Cataloged as CVE-2023-30799 (CVSS score: 9.1), the shortcoming is expected to put approximately 500,000 and 900,000 RouterOS systems at risk of exploitation via their web and/or Winbox interfaces, respectively.

 - CVE-2023-30799 does require authentication, in fact, the vulnerability itself is a simple privilege escalation from admin to 'super-admin' which results in access to an arbitrary function. Acquiring credentials to RouterOS systems is easier than one might expect.

 - This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not offer any protection against password brute-force attacks and ships with a well-known default ""admin"" user, with its password being an empty string until October 2021, at which point administrators were prompted to update the blank passwords with the release of RouterOS 6.49.

  - Mitigation advice includes removing MikroTik administrative interfaces from the internet, limiting the IP addresses administrators can login from, disabling the Winbox and the web interfaces, and configuring SSH to use public/private keys and disable passwords.",,https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/critical-mikrotik-routeros.html,https://vulncheck.com/blog/mikrotik-foisted-revisited,UNKNOWN,MEDIUM
2504,26/07/2023,30,GLOBAL,,BlackCat/ ALPHV ransomware adds data leak API in new extortion strategy,RESEARCH,ALL,,A2,MEDIUM,BlackCat/ ALPHV,Unknown,RANSOMWARE," - Reported on July 26, the ALPHV ransomware gang, also referred to as BlackCat, is trying to put more pressure on their victims to pay a ransom by providing an API for their leak site to increase visibility for their attacks.

 - This move follows the gang’s recent breach of Estée Lauder that ended with the beauty company completely ignoring the threat actor’s effort to engage in negotiations for a ransom payment.

 - Multiple researchers spotted earlier this week that the ALPHV/BlackCat data leak site added a new page with instructions for using their API to collect timely updates about new victims.

 - APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are typically used to enable communication between two software components based on agreed definitions and protocols.

 - Malware research group VX-Underground pointed to the new section on ALPHV’s site but it appears that the “feature” has been partially available for months though not to the larger audience.

 - The ransomware gang posted the API calls that would help fetch various information about new victims added to their leak site or updates starting a specific date.

 - Although the gang did not explain the release of the API, one reason could be that fewer victims are succumbing to ransomware demands.

 - A report from ransomware incident response company Coveware notes that the number of paying victims that suffered a ransomware attack “fell to a record low of 34%” in the second quarter of this year.

 - However, some threat actors continue to make big money by focusing on targeting the supply chain to breach a large number of organizations.",,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alphv-ransomware-adds-data-leak-api-in-new-extortion-strategy/,https://www.coveware.com/blog/2023/7/21/ransom-monetization-rates-fall-to-record-low-despite-jump-in-average-ransom-payments,FINANCIAL GAIN,MEDIUM
2505,25/07/2023,30,GLOBAL,,Mysterious Decoy Dog malware toolkit still lurks in DNS shadows,NEW TTPS,PUBLIC ADMIN,TARGETED INDIVIDUAL,A2,MEDIUM,Decoy Dog,Unknown,WEB THREATS," - Reported on July 25, new details have emerged about Decoy Dog, a largely undetected sophisticated toolkit likely used for at least a year in cyber intelligence operations, relying on the domain name system (DNS) for command and control activity.

 - It is unclear who is behind the malware but researchers at DNS-focused security vendor Infoblox believe that four actors are wielding and developing it for highly-targeted operations.

 - Observed activity is limited to the Russian and Eastern Europe space and appears to be related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

 -  DecoyDog likely has the ability to download malware payloads on infected devices and execute commands sent by the attackers.

 - At the time, the researchers said that they “found the identical DNS query patterns arising from enterprise networks, which could not be tied to consumer devices” and “confirmed that the queries originated from network appliances in a very limited number of customer networks.”

 - Whoever operates the toolkit did not cease activity after Infoblox announced their discovery and published a technical analysis showing that Decoy Dog was heavily based on the Pupy open-source post-exploitation remote access trojan (RAT).

 - New Infoblox research revealed that “Decoy Dog is a major upgrade from Pupy that uses commands and configurations that are not in the public repo.”

 - Some of the differences observed include:

    Decoy Dog uses Python 3.8 while Pupy was written in Python 2.7. Decoy Dog requires Python 3.8
    numerous improvements including Windows compatibility and better memory operations
    Decoy Dog significantly expands the communications vocabulary in Pupy by adding multiple communications modules
    Decoy Dog responds to replays of previous DNS queries where Pupy does not.
    unlike Pupy, Decoy Dog responds to wildcard DNS requests, which doubles the number of resolutions seen in passive DNS.
    Decoy Dog responds to DNS requests that don’t match the structure of valid communication with a client.
    Decoy Dog adds the ability to run arbitrary Java code by injecting it into a JVM thread and adds methods to maintain persistence on a victim device.

 - Based on passive DNS traffic analysis, it is difficult to determine an accurate number of Data Dog clients, which would indicate impacted devices, but the largest number of active concurrent connections that Infoblox observed on any one controller was less than 50 and the smallest was four.

 - It is estimateed that the current number of compromised devices would be less than a few hundred, indicating a very small set of targets, typical of an intelligence operation.

 - Some of the changes one Decoy Dog operator made after Infoblox’s disclosure was to add a geofencing mechanism that limits responses from controller domains to DNS queries from IP addresses in specific regions. Although this may imply that the victims are in Russia, the actor could also have chosen to route victim traffic through the region as a decoy or to limit the queries to relevant ones.

 - Infoblox distinguishes between the four actors operating Decoy Dog based on the observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). However, it appears that they all respond to queries that match the right format for Decoy Dog or Pupy. If the theory of multiple actors handling Decoy Dog is true, there may be two development groups that improved the toolkit with new functionality.

 - At the moment, Decoy Dog operations remain a mystery as far as their purpose and handlers go. Infoblox has done its part in uncovering the toolkit using DNS data from its systems and bringing it to the attention of the infosec community. However, additional research is required to determine the targets, the initial compromise method (e.g. supply chain, known vulnerability, zero-day in targeted devices), and how actors move into the network",,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mysterious-decoy-dog-malware-toolkit-still-lurks-in-dns-shadows/,https://blogs.infoblox.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/decoy-dog-is-no-ordinary-pupy-distinguishing-malware-via-dns/,ESPIONAGE,MEDIUM
2506,26/07/2023,30,GLOBAL,,"NoBit RAAS, a New Generation Ransomware Builder Marketed on Dark Web",NEW TTPS,UNKNOWN,,B1,MEDIUM,NoBit,Unknown,RANSOMWARE," - Reported on July 26, a new and powerful ransomware as a service (RAAS) has emerged and is marketing its prowess on the dark web.

 - Dubbed as NoBit RAAS builder, the malicious software is being promoted by an elusive threat actor and is being called the “hottest product” on the dark web.

 - The threat actor responsible for promoting NoBit RAAS builder is not holding back on its claims of destructive capabilities. The ransomware builder’s straightforward interface enables even novice hackers to easily create potent ransomware strains.

 - One of the aspects of NoBit RAAS builder is its ability to encrypt virtually any file, leaving no data safe from its grasp. This includes sensitive information tucked away in directories like the recycle bin and AppData, where users often store personal and important files.

 - This includes sensitive information tucked away in directories like the recycle bin and AppData, where users often store personal and important files.

 - According to the threat actor’s post, the NoBit RAAS builder offers a range of powerful features that make it the weapon of choice for malicious actors.

 - For $200, users gain access to a lifetime license for the builder, allowing them to create unlimited ransomware strains. If they wish to explore the source code and delve into the program’s inner workings, it comes at a higher price tag of $1000.

 - The builder comes equipped with a range of essential blocks that users can manipulate to customize their ransomware.

 - Among these are a key block, an AES-128 key, and a wallpaper editor, allowing users to craft a unique and ominous message for their victims.

 - Additionally, there’s a ransom note block where users can draft and upload their demands in .rtf file format, specifying the ransom amount and the contact email for negotiating the payment.

 - A separate miscellaneous section allows users to omit language restrictions, ensuring that the ransom demand reaches a wide audience.

 - Once the NoBit RAAS attack has been successfully executed on a victim’s computer, a threat message is displayed on the desktop, leaving them with very few options.

 - The message explicitly states that all their files have been encrypted using an advanced encryption system, and the only way to regain access to their precious data is by paying the hefty ransom of $5000.

 - The threat actors are cunning enough to warn victims against changing file types, editing the content, or decrypting the files without the provided key, as it could lead to irreversible data loss.

 - The contact email, NoBit@yourcomputer, serves as the point of contact between the victims and the malicious actors. Once the payment is made, victims are instructed to click the “Decrypt…” button to initiate the decryption process using the provided key.

 - NoBit RAAS builder is a dangerous and sophisticated ransomware as a service that highlights the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals. Since NoBit RAAS builder is active on the dark web marketplaces, threat actors might want to invest in this service to create ransomware strains, which can later be used to target unsuspecting victims. Apart from RAAS builders, leaked code also come handy for cybercriminals.",,https://thecyberexpress.com/nobit-raas-new-generation-ransomware-builder/,https://twitter.com/Cyberknow20/status/1683839884480622599,FINANCIAL GAIN,MEDIUM

 - As reported, the Spyhide stalkerware has been installed on 60,000 Android phones since 2016. Unlike malicious apps which send stolen data to hackers, Spyhide and other stalkerware apps steal sensitive data and send it back to spouses or other people looking to keep tabs on victims.

 - What makes stalkerware apps so dangerous is their ability to stay hidden on a compromised phone which makes them difficult to detect and uninstall. Once loaded onto an Android smartphone, Spyhide silently collects and uploads a victim’s contacts, messages, photos, call logs, recordings of their calls and even their location in real-time.

 - While Spyhide has been quietly collecting data on victims for years now, a Switzerland-based hacker has managed to gain access to part of the stalkerware’s development environment which has shed new light on this stalkerware.

 - The hacker was able to gain access to Spyhide’s back-end database by exploiting a vulnerability in the stalkerware’s dashboard and has detailed their findings in a new blog post.

 - The stalkerware’s database contains detailed records of 60,000 compromised Android devices including call logs, text messages and years of location history. Alongside this sensitive data, there’s also information about each file like when a photo or video was taken and uploaded by Spyhide.

 - According to TechCrunch’s analysis, Spyhide’s operations are worldwide. While there are only 3,100 compromised devices in the U.S., American victims are the most surveilled based on the fact that there are more than 100,000 location data points in the country alone.

 - At the same time, the stalkerware’s database also contains records on 750,000 users that signed up to gain access to Spyhide, likely with the intention of installing the stalkerware on someone else’s smartphone.

 - Additionally, the database includes 3.29 million text messages, 2FA codes, password reset links, over 1.2 million call logs, 312,00 call recording files, 925,000+ contact lists and records for 382,000 photos and images.

(Unsuspecting Email Users)",PHISHING," - Reported on July 25, a new phishing threat that has been circulating via email, targeting unsuspecting users with the deceptive subject ""Bank Payment Notice"". This malicious campaign, orchestrated by cybercriminals, aims to steal victims' email login credentials for illicit purposes.

- The modus operandi of the attack involves sending an email that appears legitimate, notifying recipients of a supposed bank payment in their favor. To ""view"" the payment receipt, users are invited to click on a link provided in the email body. Once the user clicks on the link, they are redirected to a fake webpage that appears to belong to a legitimate bank or payment service. On this page, two images are displayed: a fake invoice and a fake bank transfer receipt, both skillfully created to appear authentic.

- However, to download these documents, the victim is asked to provide their email login credentials, including the email address and associated password. This is where the malicious actors attempt to exploit people's good faith for malicious purposes.

- If successful, the cybercriminals steal the victim's credentials, granting them unauthorized access to the email account. Once this access is obtained, the user's personal, financial, and sensitive data become prey to the scammers. The consequences can be severe and include identity theft, reputation damage, and potential financial harm.

- The ""Bank Payment Notice"" phishing campaign is just one example of scams aimed at taking advantage of users' inexperience.
