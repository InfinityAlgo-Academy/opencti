**Security Assessment Report for DarkLight, Inc.**

# Executive Summary
This security assessment report contains results of the comprehensive security test
and evaluation of organization's enterprise infrastructure between 2022-03-18 and 2022-03-18
to support DarkLight, Inc. in making risk-based decisions.



The table below represents the aggregate risks identified by the assessment.  Risk
is determined by likelihood (the probability that a threat will exploit a vulnerability)
and impact (magnitude of harm that results from the successful exploitation of a
vulnerability), as well as context about the infrastructure and the effectiveness of the
controls that are used to protect it.

Risks identified as Operationally Required for continued operation are called out
separately since those risks have not been remediating and still have some residual
associated with them.


|Risk Category|Total|% of Total Risks|
|:------------|:---:|---------------:|
|Very High|1|2.3%|
|High|2|4.5%|
|Moderate|32|72.7%|
|Low|9|20.5%|
|Very Low|0|0.0%|
|Operationally Required|0|0.0%|
|**Total Risks**|44|100%|
