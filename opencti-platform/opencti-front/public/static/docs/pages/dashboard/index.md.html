# Executive Summary
This security assessment report contains results of the comprehensive security test
and evaluation of organization's enterprise infrastructure between 2022-03-18 and 2022-03-18
to support DarkLight, Inc. in making risk-based decisions.



The table below represents the aggregate risks identified by the assessment.  Risk
is determined by likelihood (the probability that a threat will exploit a vulnerability)
and impact (magnitude of harm that results from the successful exploitation of a
vulnerability), as well as context about the infrastructure and the effectiveness of the
controls that are used to protect it.

Risks identified as Operationally Required for continued operation are called out
separately since those risks have not been remediating and still have some residual
associated with them.

# System Overview
The organization's enterprise infrastructure defines this is a description of the assessment target.

The purpose of the organization's enterprise infrastructure is to provide this is a description of the purpose of the assessment target.

## Security Categorization
The organization's enterprise infrastructure is categorized as a moderate impact as determined
in accordance with [**FIPS 199**](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.199), *Standard
for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems*.

# Assessment Methodology

The methodology used to conduct the security assessment of organization's enterprise infrastructure is summarized in the following steps:

1. Perform tests and record the results
2. Identify vulnerabilities
3. Identify threats and determine which threats are associated with the cited vulnerabilities
4. Analyze risks based on vulnerabilities and associated threats
5. Recommend corrective actions
6. Document the results

## Perform Tests
DarkLight, Inc. preformed security tests on organization's enterprise infrastructure which were concluded
on 2022-03-18.



The results of the tests are recorded in the Assessment Results Appendix.  The findings
of the security tests serve as inputs to this security assessment report.


A separate attack surface/penetration test was performed, with the results
documented in Pentration Testing Appendix of this security assessment report.



## Identification of Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities have been identified by DarkLight, Inc. for organization's enterprise infrastructure as part
of the security assessment.

A *vulnerability* is an inherent weakness in an information system and/or
infrastructure that can be exploited by a threat or threat agent, resulting in
an undesirable impact on the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of the system (application and associated data).  A vulnerability
may be due to a design flaw or error in configuration which makes the network,
or a host on the network, susceptible to malicious attacks from local or
remote users.

Vulnerabilities can exist in multiple areas of the system, such as in firewalls,
application servers, web servers, or operating systems.

Whether or not a vulnerability has the potential to be exploited by a threat
depends upon variables including (but not limited to):

* Strength of the security controls in place
* Ease at which a human actor could purposefully launch an attack

Depending on the level of risk exposure, the successful exploitation of a
vulnerability varies from disclosure of information about the host to
complete compromise of the host.  Risk exposure to organizational operations
can affect the business mission, functions, and/or reputation of the
organization.

## Consideration of Threats
A *threat* is an adversarial force or phenomenon that could impact the
availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an information system and its
networks including the facility that houses the hardware and software.  A
*threat agent* is an element that provides the delivery mechanism for a threat.
An entity that initiates the launch of a threat agent is referred to as a
*threat actor*.

A threat actor might purposefully launch a threat agent.  However, a threat
actor could also be a trusted employee that acts as an agent by making an
unintentional human error (e.g., a trusted staff clicks on a phishing email
that downloads malware).  Threat agents work alone, or in concert, to
exploit vulnerabilities to create incidents.

Threats purposefully launched, known as "*purposeful threats*", are launched
by threat actors for a variety of reasons and those reasons may not be fully
known.  Threat actors could be motivated by curiosity, monetary gain, political
gain, social activism, revenge, or many other driving forces.  It is possible
that some threat actors could have more than one motivation.

Some threats are more likely to occur than others.  This information is
considered to help determine the likelihood that a vulnerability
could be exploited.

\pagebreak

# Perform Risk Analysis
The goal of determining risk exposure is to facilitate decision making on how
to respond to real and perceived risks.  The outcome of performing risk analysis
yields risk exposure metrics that can be used to make risk-based decisions.
This assessment utilized a qualitative risk analysis, where the likelihood and
impact of successfully exploiting a threat is measured in relative terms.

## Likelihood Threat Event Results in Adverse Impacts
*Likelihood* refers to the probability that a given threat is capable of
exploiting a given vulnerability.  Determining likelihood involves determining
that a threat event will be initiated or that it will occur, and determining the
likelihood that a threat event will result in adverse impacts.

For adversarial threats, the likelihood is based on (1) adversary intent;
(2) adversary capability; and (3) adversary targeting.  For non-adversarial threats,
likelihood is based on the likelihood of occurrence based on historical evidence,
empirical data, and other factors.

Likelihood definitions for the exploitation of vulnerabilities are found in the
table below.  When a system or infrastructure is easy to exploit, it has a high
likelihood that a threat actor could exploit the vulnerability.

|Likelihood|Description|
|:---------|:----------|
|**Very High**|Adversary is **almost certain** to initiate the threat event, and if the threat event is initiated or occurs, it is **almost certain** to have adverse impacts|
|**High**|Adversary is **highly likely** to initiate the threat event, and if the threat event is initiated or occurs, it is **highly likely** to have adverse impacts|
|**Moderate**|Adversary is **somewhat likely** to initiate the threat event, and if the threat event is initiated or occurs, it is **somewhat likely** to have adverse impacts|
|**Low**|Adversary is **unlikely** to initiate the threat event, and if the threat event is initiated or occurs, it is **unlikely** to have adverse impacts|
|**Very Low**|Adversary is **highly unlikely** to initiate the threat event, and if the threat event is initiated or occurs, it is **highly unlikely** to have adverse impacts|
[Table [tableNum]: Risk Likelihood Definitions]


## Impact
*Impact* refers to the magnitude of potential harm that can be expected to result
from unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized modification of information,
unauthorized destruction of information, or loss of the availability of the information system.

Definitions for the impact resulting from the exploitation of a vulnerability
are described in the table below.  Since exploitation has not yet occurred,
these values are *perceived values*.  If the exploitation of a vulnerability
causes significant loss of a system or its data, then the impact of the
exploit is considered to be high.

|Impact|Description|
|:-----|:----------|
|**Very High**|The threat event could be expected to have **multiple severe or catastrophic** adverse effects on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, or other organizations.|
|**High**|The threat event could be expected to have a **severe or catastrophic** adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, or other organizations. Examples of severe or catastrophic adverse effects include threat events that: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss.|
|**Moderate**|The threat event could be expected to have a **serious** adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals or other organizations. Examples of serious adverse effects include threat events that: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial loss.|
|**Low**|The threat event could be expected to have a **limited** adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individualism or other organizations. Examples of limited adverse effects include threat events that: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss.|
|**Very Low**|The threat event could be expected to have a **negligible** adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, or other organizations.|
[Table [tableNum]: Risk Impact Definitions]


## Risk Exposure
*Risk Exposure* refers to the level of risk an organization would be exposed to
if a vulnerability were to be initiated and successfully exploited.  The combination
of High likelihood and High impact creates the highest risk exposure.  The risk
exposure matrix shown in the table below presents the same likelihood and impact
severity ratings as those found in [NIST SP 800-30: *Risk Management Guide for
Information Technology Systems*](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf).
Analyzing the likelihood and impact of each vulnerability, based upon the
potential threats yields a Risk Exposure as shown below.

## Risk Level
*Risk Level* refers to an organization's level of exposure to from a successful
exploitation of a vulnerability and the liabilities that that can stem from the
event.  The table below provides a qualitative set of values that are used to
express the level of risk.

|Risk Level|Description|
|:--------:|:----------|
|**Very High**|A threat event could be expected to have multiple severe or catastrophic adverse effects on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the company.|
|**High**|A threat event could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the company.|
|**Moderate**|A threat event could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the company.|
|**Low**|A threat event could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the company.|
|**Very Low**|A threat event could be expected to have a negligible adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the company.|
[Table [tableNum]: Risk Level Definitions]

DarkLight, Inc. has reviewed all identified weaknesses and assigned a risk level to the
weaknesses based on these tables.  All identified risks have been assigned the
risk level identified by the scanning tool.


## Document Results
Documenting the results of security testing creates a record of the security posture
for the system and its infrastructure at a given moment in time.  The record can be
reviewed for risk-based decision making and to create plans of action to mitigate risks.

*Plan of Action and Milestones* are utilized as the primary mechanism for
tracking all security weaknesses and issues.  Together, a Plan of Action and Milestones
provide mitigation plans designed to address specific residual security weaknesses and
include information on costing, resources, and target dates.

# Assessment Results
This section documents the results of the assessment. It captures the risks
that are currently open, including those with residual risk, such as accepted risk.

## Assessment Summary
The Assessment Summary table provides a count of risks at a particular level and for each
assessment technique. Each technique utilized in the assessment is represented as a
row that shows how many risks the technique identified at each risk level, the total number
of risks identifies, and percentage of the overall total number of risk that were identified by
the technique.

Some techniques may not be applicable to this assessment or may not be supported in Cyio.

The "Total" row shows the overall count of "open" risks at each risk level and a count of 
the overall number of "open" risks across all risk levels.

: occurrence and/or lessen its consequences

NIST
: The National Institute of Standards and Technology promotes U.S. innovation and
: industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and
: technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.



Plan of Action and Milestone
: The primary mechanism for tracking all security
: weaknesses and issues. Together a Plan of Action and Milestones provide a
: plan designed to address responses to specific, residual security weaknesses and
: include cost, resource, and target date information.

POC
: Point of Contact



Risk
: A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by
: a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i) the adverse
: impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the
: likelihood of occurrence.

Risk Assessment (RA)
: The product or process of identifying risks to organizational
: operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets,
: individuals, other organizations, performed by collecting information and assigning
: values to risks for the purpose of informing priorities, developing or comparing
: courses of action, and informing decision making.

Risk Mitigation
: Prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing
: controls/countermeasures recommended from a risk management process.

Risk Response
: Accepting, avoiding, mitigating, sharing, or transferring risk to organizational
: operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets,
: individuals, other organizations, or the company.

Remediation
: The application of one or more measures that will eliminate the potential threat
: caused by an exploit of a vulnerability or weakness.

Security Assessment Report
: The report as a result of a security assessment that provides visibility into specific weaknesses
: and deficiencies in the security controls used within or inherited by the information
: system that remain unresolved. Such weaknesses and deficiencies are potential vulnerabilities
: if exploitable by a threat source.



SP
: Special Publication; See *NIST*

System Security Plan
: A formal document that provides an overview of the security requirements for an
: information system and describes the security controls in place or planned for
: meeting those requirements.

Threat
: An adversarial force or phenomenon that could impact the availability,
: integrity, or confidentiality of an information system and its networks
: including the facility that houses the hardware and software.

Threat Actor
: An entity that initiates the launch of a threat agent

Threat Agent
: An element that provides the delivery mechanism for a threat

Threat Analysis
: The detailed evaluation that identifies and assesses the capabilities and
: activities of adversaries and produces findings to help increase awareness
: and knowledge that can be used in build defenses to attacks, initialize or
: support law enforcement and counterintelligence investigations or activities.

Vulnerability
: An inherent weakness in an information system or infrastructure that can
: be exploited by a threat or threat agent, resulting in an undesirable impact
: in the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the
: system (application and associated data) and infrastructure.

Weakness
: A shortcoming or imperfection in software code, design, architecture, or deployment
: that, under proper conditions, could become a vulnerability or contribute to the
: introduction of vulnerabilities.
